# Curse Quest

Curse Quest is a fantasy RPG. The goal is story driven fantasy tale with some stats and randomly generated / roguelike-inspired mechanics complimented by ASCII art.

## Story

You are Kryll of Klathia, heir to the Klathian Throne. The Uncrowned King usurped the title from you and banished you to a life of exile. In your wandering you have come across a legendary magical sword. But instead of granting you the power you need to slay the Uncrowned King and reclaim your throne, the sword has cursed you. You must find a way to lift the curse or you will fall under the sword's control.

The central quest will involve ridding yourself of the cursed sword and reclaiming your throne. Ideally at least a dozen side quests that can tie into the ending of the main quest. At the end of the day, a story that contains numerous branching endings which are satisfying and replayable.

## World

The world will features a traversible grid, currently thinking a randomly generated overworld with random encounters sprinkled in with story scenes, and a fixed set of dungeons to explore. Maybe a procedural underdark?
