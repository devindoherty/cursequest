# Curse Quest

Curse Quest is a fantasy RPG in Python's wrapper of Curses. Hopefully a side project I can work on to expand my knowledge of Python.

## Main Quest

You are Kryll of Klathia, heir to the Klathian Throne. The Uncrowned King usurped the title from you and banished you to a life of exile. In your wandering you have come across a legendary magical sword. But instead of granting you the power you need to slay the Uncrowned King and reclaim your throne, the sword has cursed you. You must find a way to lift the curse or you will fall under the sword's control.
