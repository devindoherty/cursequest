# Curse Quest

Curse Quest is a fantasy RPG in Python's wrapper of Curses. Hopefully a side project I can work on to expand my knowledge of Python.

## Story

You are Kryll of Klathia, heir to the Klathian Throne. The Uncrowned King usurped the title from you and banished you to a life of exile. In your wandering you have come across a legendary magical sword. But instead of granting you the power you need to slay the Uncrowned King and reclaim your throne, the sword has cursed you. You must find a way to lift the curse or you will fall under the sword's control.

The central quest will involve ridding yourself of the cursed sword and reclaiming your throne. Ideally at least a dozen side quests that can tie into the ending of the main quest. At the end of the day, a story that contains numerous branching endings is satisfying and replayable.

## World

The world will feature a y by x (size to be determined) traversible grid, hopefully with each location having something unique about it.

## Systems

Most story elements should be handled by a standard choose your own adventure system, perhaps with some limited parser interaction for naming things or whatnot.

A stats system that tracks maybe Intellect, Might, and Soul, or something along those lines. A skill or perk system on top of that for changing certain game encounters.

A combat system that can take advantage tactical decision making in an attack/defense system.
