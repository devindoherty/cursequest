          The healer looks apprehensive. "I dare not touch it. It bears the mark of a terrible curse."
          She studies the sword for a moment and looks at you worriedly.

        "You are free to leave, but know this: The Shir Valley is relatively safe, 
        yet the realm beyond is dangerous. Uncrowned King holds court upon the Klathian throne. His armies 
        are vast, and his sorceries vile. Evil creatures are drawn to him in these dark times. 
        The elven queen hides in her forest realm and the dwarven king cowers 
        in his mountain hall. The Klathian lords have all sworn fealty to the Uncrowned King.
        Any who would openly defy him, especially those he has cursed, would be doomed to fail. 
        Even those whose claim to the throne is strong."
